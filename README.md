# Deep-Learning

This folder contains Neural Network, CNN, RNN architectures made by Archit Naik and Melih Ekinci as course project in FAU.
Architectures are made using NumPy.

Neural Network architecture consist of <br>
a basic optimizer (SGD),<br>
a base layer,<br>
a fully connected layer,<br>
ReLU and SoftMax Layers as activation functions,<br>
and cross entropy loss function.

On top of the structures in NN, CNN architecture consist of <br>
a set of initializers (Constant, UniformRandom, Xavier and He), <br>
advanced optimizers (SGD with Momentum and Adam), <br>
Flatten, convolution and pooling layers.
